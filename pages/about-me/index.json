I'm an amatuer artist who does art and read sometimes in my freetime, and may program here and there (but not often - otherwise I'd be scratching my head alot right now).<br><br>Things about me<hr><span style='font-size: 0.95em !important'>Gender: Female (transfem)<br>Birthday: 2008/15/11<br>I'm diagnosed with ADHD (previously misdiagnosed with Autism)<br>I struggle talking to people, and may say or do something wrong or harmful (in this case, please let me know - ty :D)<br>My mental status is confusing, so if I act unusual, or odd, that's why.<br>I'm obsessed with pink (and maybe black or yellow).<br><br>Note: I don't do art commissions, nor for programming (please do not ask me for help or questions on this - I'm in no way an expert at all. I mostly look up things and hope for the best that whatever I put here works.)</span></span>"
