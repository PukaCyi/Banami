# Banami | Nekoweb
This is a not-quite exact mirror of "banami.nekoweb.org". This is meant to be a improved version of Cyiara, a old "about me" page thing that never turned out to be good to me. 

This isn't finished yet, and I doubt it'll be finished in like a week.

## What's Nekoweb?
Nekoweb is similar to Neocities. It is a free to use web hosting tool created by Dimden (check them out, they're making awesome stuff).

also check out nekoweb it cool :3
