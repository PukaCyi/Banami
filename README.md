## What's Nekoweb?
Nekoweb is a free static, web hosting service created by D1mden and the team behind Nekoweb. It works almost exactly like Neocities, and comes with other features, such as terminals and "nice links" (which doesn't include file extensions at the end of pages.) Check out nekoweb when possible :3
