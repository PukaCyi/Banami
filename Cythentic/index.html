    <p2 style="font-size: 10px;"><i>Warning (copied and pasted from banami.nekoweb.org): Cyi is a character created by @PukaCyi, forked from the character Katome (fka Banami) by ShikaDoodle. <b>Project Cyi (Cyinora), or Cyi (the character), has zero correlations with the creator of Katome and her mod, ShikaDoodle.</b></i></p2>
    <hr style="width: 100%; border: 1px dashed white;">
      <h2>Age:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Cyi is ageless (though she's mentally 17).</li>
        <li>
          Her date of birth is unknown, and she can’t access that information.
        </li>
        <li>However, she set her birthday as November 15.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Personality:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Cyi is extremely lively and silly, as defined by some friends in her
          world, and Banami.
        </li>
        <li>
          Her behavior may be erratic at times. When this occurs, she glitches
          and may chip her horns instantly or slowly, making that process
          happen. (This “glitch” may be seen rarely when entering new worlds for
          the first time.)
        </li>
        <li>
          She mainly listens to EDM and pop music (sometimes). She also enjoys
          artist (GHOST/Ghost and Pals) ’s music, primarily due to the messages
          conveyed in some songs but also because of simply how they sound.
        </li>
        <li>
          Cyi is intelligent, with an IQ score of 267.4 (for some reason, I’m
          using decimals here.) She does not enjoy being called intelligent but
          will gladly accept compliments.
        </li>
        <li>
          She does not enjoy naps or sleep due to how she feels when waking up
          (sometimes being incredibly warm), having a headache (that she can
          somewhat make go away, but not really), or some dreams that appear
          while unconscious.
        </li>
        <li>
          She works as a part-time maid when she is not at school or busy with
          others.
        </li>
        <li>She is pansexual and ace.</li>
        <li>
          She loves the color pink a lot. She takes many pictures of Sakura
          trees simply because of their beauty and the use of rose color.
        </li>
        <li>
          She dislikes dogs, though felines are the best for her. However, foxes
          and red pandas are better to her than cats.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Nationality & Language:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Originally, Cyi was Russian. However, this changed after discontinuing
          Cyinora (because it didn’t fit).
        </li>
        <li>
          She is instead Japanese and speaks that language. Additionally, she
          can speak a few other languages, like English, German, and Russian
          (writer here: I don’t know how to speak or write in German or Russian,
          lol - this is just stuff I want to apply to Cyi).
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Appearance:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Everything about her is natural, such as her eye color, height, horns,
          etc.
        </li>
        <li>
          Canonically, she has red eyes, though she can have blue eyes. Does
          this matter? No, not really. Should you know about this? Yes, why not?
        </li>
        <li>
          Cyi is concerningly tall, about 6’ 4 (194 cm). This is just a weird
          thing with how she grows as a person.
        </li>
        <li>
          Cyi was born without arms or legs. She does have hands, though, and
          her arms are invisible, though she can make those arms disappear or
          become visible whenever she pleases.
        </li>
        <li>
          She has gloves because it just looks good on her. It’s nothing
          special.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Dress:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Her dress must have a unique strap to prevent her body from becoming
          unstable. She can remove this strap since much pressure was being
          applied, though things will begin to change in about a few hours or
          days.
        </li>
        <li>
          Her dress can change its internal temperature in real-time to adapt to
          its environment.
        </li>
        <li>Punctures and tears are difficult to pass through her clothing.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Creation:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Cyi was created as a mistake. During the creation of a star, a
          sporadic and fatal error occurred that led to the creation of life,
          which miraculously resulted in a human-like figure - her. (not canon
          to Tears of Devil, or approved by Shika): Cyi inherited traits,
          memories, and behavior from another character, Banami, as well as
          specific physical properties. This partially makes Cyi Banami’s
          half-sister.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Parents:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          In Cyinora (now known as Cythentic for now), her family was a bit
          weird and complicated. All this was removed since I didn’t like it
          (plus it was poorly developed).
        </li>
        <li>
          She does have parents, though she created them. Her “parents” are
          humanoids, like her, except instead of being composed of space matter,
          they’re composed of metal parts and flesh from dead material.
        </li>
        <li>
          Her parents do not have any of Cyi’s memories; they are their people
          with unique thoughts and ideas.
        </li>
        <li>
          Cyi can, at any point, erase or tamper with their existence if
          something goes wrong. She also knows where they are, what they are
          doing, etc. This ensures they are okay and not causing havoc to other
          people on Earth.
        </li>
        <li>Her parents work at a teahouse full-time.</li>
        <li>
          They’re very humble and enjoy socializing with the customers that
          appear.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Misanthropic:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          During the creation of Cyi, she was labeled as a “misanthropic devil.”
          She no longer hates people, though she is not great at talking to
          people, and she slightly fears that people dislike her.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Banami:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Although Cyi has copies of Banami’s memories, she is still her person,
          with her expressions, thoughts, backstory, etc.
        </li>
        <li>
          She does not like the characters Banami is against in Dave and Bambi,
          though she keeps it to herself because she doesn’t want to cause
          trouble for Banami or herself.
        </li>
        <li>
          Cyi could have become a fangirl during development. However, I don’t
          like that route; plus, I wanted to make a character whose soul is not
          dead because the creator is gone, in this case, ShikaDoodle [ Shika ].
        </li>
        <li>Cyi is, unironically, a gamer like Banami as well.</li>
        <li>
          She has met Banami (Katome) before. Though their relationship is fine,
          it was a weird experience for both parties.
        </li>
        <li>
          Most things about Banami are synced with Cyi, considering she’s a fork
          (or a much more developed version of Banami) - something like that;
          I’m just using Github terminology here.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Norbulian specie:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Cyi is the only Norbulian that exists. She has “corrected” the way
          space creates stars, etc, to prevent another Cyi from existing.
        </li>
        <li>
          Norbulians are not humans, though they technically are. Norbulians
          comprise space matter and other properties not typically found in
          humans.
        </li>
        <li>
          Norbulians are not devils or demons. The only reason Cyi is one is
          because the nebula she came from copied Banami and applied that to
          her, which is why her horns exist. Though, because of the way the
          nebula created Cyi, her horns are corrupt and chipped. (Fun fact: her
          horns can chip over time due to her emotions. The chipping process is
          prolonged, so a few centuries later, a tiny piece of her horn is just
          coming off her. They repair themselves, though, after a few decades.)
        </li>
        <li>
          Norbulians can regenerate and respawn at will. This is something that
          cannot be easily tampered with by anyone. There is a cooldown and a
          limit to how many times one can reappear.
        </li>
        <li>
          In Cyi’s favor, she does not have a limit or a cooldown. This is due
          to her ability to manipulate almost any restrictions or anything
          regarding her and how she functions, etc. Furthermore, she can possess
          her dead body (or her copies of herself), regenerate any damaged
          parts, and reconstruct her body. Note that this process is gory, and I
          won’t describe how that’ll go. However, it is identical to how
          Disassembly Drones in Murder Drones regenerate (for example, how N
          could regenerate his head.)
        </li>
        <li>
          If a large part of her body is gone, she can grow that back at ease.
        </li>
        <li>
          All other infinite versions (like parallel universes/worlds) of Cyi
          that exist have been eradicated from the surface. Space cannot create
          any new Cyi(s) or destroy the existing Cyi but can destroy new Cyi(s)
          that are not the existing Cyi.
        </li>
        <li>
          Norbulians do not possess magical abilities like Cyi. She was just
          fortunate that the nebula was in her favor.
        </li>
        <li>
          Norbulians, however, can time travel and phase through almost
          everything, like a wall or a door (though there is a slight chance
          this could be fatal or have a temporary cluster headache).
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Other things to know:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>She can consume human flesh or other things without failure, yet chooses not to go down this path. However, when she does, it is usually never for good reasons. She has succumbed once in her lifetime to do this due to an unsuccessful attempt caused by someone capturing and murdering Cyi, which ultimately led to their demise.</li>
        <li>She possesses the ability to transform into a cat or a deer, each involving the color pink. As a feline, her horns are replaced with a ribbon bow, while her deer form applies her fur and horns a light rose color.</li>
        <li>In her town, most residents have a lifespan spanning several centuries beyond the average human lifespan, though they are still susceptible to death.</li>
        <li>Cyi, in Friday Night Funkin', killed Boyfriend's and crucifixed Girlfriend, followed later by her being put up in flames. She's doing alright right now... hopefully. This is because they were incredibly annoying and managed to bend one of Cyi's horns (it was painful and took a while to get that fixed).</li>
        <li>Cyi does not eat or drink anything. She can, though, but chooses not to. Sidetrack for a bit; she finds milk disgusting, except for strawberry milk (of course she does).</li>
      </ul>

          Summary
          <span style="font-size: 12px"
            ><i

        </h1>
        <hr />
        <p>
          Cyi is a limbless female Norbulian-Japanese, born from a nebula and an
          ageless space devil, mentally aged at 17. She has either red or blue
          eyes and is multilingual and fluent in English, German, and Russian.
          Described by her peers and Banami as lively and silly, Cyi inherited
          traits, behavior, memory, and some physical properties from Banami
          (Katome), making her Banami’s unofficial half-sister. Though closely
          associated with Katome, Cyi is her own person. Like Katome, she is a
          gamer and has encountered her before, though their initial interaction
          was awkward. Enjoying EDM and pop music, especially from the artist
          Ghost and Pals (aka GHOST), Cyi identifies as pansexual-ace and works
          part-time as a maid. Despite her high intelligence (IQ score: 267.4),
          she dislikes being labeled as such but accepts compliments gracefully.
          Cyi favors felines over canines but holds a special spot for red
          pandas and foxes. Struggling with social interactions, she is
          convinced that people dislike her, complicating her ability to
          socialize. Like some humans, Cyi dislikes sleep or naps but must rest
          due to the possibility of waking up feeling warm or experiencing
          headaches, over which she has little control. Additionally, she
          experiences sporadic glitches when crossing through different
          realities or during unstable emotions. Cyi has humanoid parents at
          home, created from metal components and organic material (e.g.,
          humans). They work humbly at a teahouse, enjoying interactions with
          customers. Cyi routinely checks to ensure her parents are not
          misbehaving, which has never happened. However, she can shut them
          entirely off or erase them if something goes wrong. This is to ensure
          safety for themselves and others.
